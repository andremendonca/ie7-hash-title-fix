 How it works?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Just put the script in your page.

### TIP

Put the script inside the `<head>` tag or right before the opening of the `<boby>` tag, this way it will correct the title instanctly, and the user won't notice. If you put in the end like the best practices says, it'll have an delay.
